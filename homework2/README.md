Resources used:  
I used the docs given in the homework, with some youtube videos and AI for things that weren't immediately obvious to me in the docs  
AI was used primarily for exploring concepts, but some parts of the code, especially the HTML, are pretty much straight from ChatGPT or Bootstrap examples
